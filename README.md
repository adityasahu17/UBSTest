#UBS Test

#App.java is the entry point.Have implemented factory design pattern so that we can reuse the code and decouple the input from the basic functionality. For this perticular test I have implemented for console input.

#ReaderFactory.java for initialising input reader object.

#BookService interface for service layer.This interface is designed for user interaction, each function is responsible for a specific task.

#MapUtil.java is the utility class for sorting.
